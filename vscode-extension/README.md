# VSCode Extension

This is an early WIP VSCode extension. It has the goal of enabling support for functionality such as:

-   [ ] (Cursor / VSCode): Automatic generation of build, launch, and debug tasks

-   [ ] (Cursor / VSCode): Test explorer & ability to run tests from within the IDE by clicking the tests individually, similarly to Xcode

-   [ ] Automatic index and build graph updates when adding / deleting files and targets (in other words, allowing the user to make heavy changes to the project without needing to restart the IDE)

The extension is in active development and is not yet ready for use.
