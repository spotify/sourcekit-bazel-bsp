# VSCode Extension

This is an early WIP VSCode extension. It has the goal of enabling support for functionality such as:

## Basic Features
-   [ ] See and choose devices (simulators/physical devices)
-   [ ] Query and select Bazel targets
-   [ ] Build, run, and test targets
-   [ ] Generate BSP config for code intelligence

## Intermediate Features
-   [ ] Full LLDB debugging support
-   [ ] Simulator control (start/stop, screenshots)
-   [ ] Build mode selection (Debug/Release)
-   [ ] Tool detection and installation

## Advanced Features
-   [ ] (Cursor / VSCode): Automatic generation of build, launch, and debug tasks
-   [ ] (Cursor / VSCode): Test explorer & ability to run tests from within the IDE by clicking the tests individually, similarly to Xcode
-   [ ] Automatic index and build graph updates when adding / deleting files and targets (in other words, allowing the user to make heavy changes to the project without needing to restart the IDE)
-   [ ] MCP server for AI assistant integration
-   [ ] Custom build commands per target
-   [ ] BSP graph report parsing for smart target mapping

The extension is in active development and is not yet ready for use.
